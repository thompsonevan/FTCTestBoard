 *
 * This code is for _Auto_runs
 *
 * Changes to this program will run an autonomous path
 *
 * To run with a Red allience, set alliance = RED.
 * To run with a Blue allience, set alliance = BLUE.
 *
 * in the method "tasks" invoke the methods desired in sequence from
 *   shippingHub  // to move to the hub and deposit the block in the conveyor
 *   carousel     // to move to the carousel and rotate to drop the duck
 *
 *  then to the desired parking location
 *   storage      // enter storage
 *   freight      // enter freight
 *   freight_park // move to an alternate location in freight
 *
 *  Between each operation, and optional sleep value may be specified to avoid
 *  alliance collisions.
 *
 *  The variable "loc" has the x and y coordinates for the starting location.  This is
 *  used as a seed to start the robot, and each of the methods above use the result of
 *  the previous method to advancce to the desired position.
 *
 *  Note that all distance measurements are in centimeters (CM).
